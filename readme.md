This repository contains the backend code for an application, built using the Express framework and utilizing MySQL as the database.

The code is organized into different modules that handle different aspects of the application, such as authentication, data retrieval and manipulation, and error handling. The Express framework provides a robust set of tools and features for building web applications, including middleware for handling requests and responses, and routing for directing traffic to the appropriate handlers.

The MySQL database is used to store and manage application data, including user information, session data, and other application-specific data. The code includes a number of database models that define the structure and behavior of the data, as well as functions for querying and manipulating the data.

Overall, this repository provides a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and secure backend for a web application, using industry-standard tools and frameworks.
